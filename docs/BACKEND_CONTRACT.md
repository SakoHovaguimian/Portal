# Backend integration contract

`PORTAL_API_URL` is the server-only API base URL, including any prefix (for example `http://localhost:3000/api`). Browser paths are relative to `/api/backend`. The proxy adds `Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>` and `app-version: <APP_VERSION>`. Requests/responses are uncached. Only a fixed set of request/response headers is forwarded. Incoming browser bearer/cookie/host headers are never copied upstream.

Portal preserves its existing snake_case user/feature/dashboard transports and maps them to camelCase domain models in [domainMappers](../src/services/api/domainMappers.ts). Transport definitions live in independent files under [models](../src/services/api/models/). They are maintained source, not generated OpenAPI output.

| Method and path relative to API base | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| GET `/users/profile` | Authenticated application user, including application ID and Firebase `external_id` |
| POST `/users` | Provision application user after Firebase signup; accepts first_name, last_name, email, external_id |
| GET `/users?query=&limit=25&offset=0` | Page of UserTransport |
| GET `/users/:id` | UserTransport |
| PUT `/users/:id` | Current user profile mutation; backend derives owner from token |
| GET `/feature-requests?query=&limit=25&offset=0` | Page of the current user's FeatureRequestTransport |
| GET `/feature-requests/:id` | Current user's FeatureRequestTransport |
| POST `/feature-requests` | `{ message }`; owner derived from token |
| PATCH `/feature-requests/:id` | `{ message }`; enforce ownership |
| DELETE `/feature-requests/:id` | Enforce ownership; 204 on success |
| GET `/dashboard/overview` | DashboardOverviewTransport |
| GET `/dashboard/models` | `{ models: DashboardModelSummaryTransport[] }` |
| GET `/dashboard/models/:key` | DashboardModelMetaTransport |
| GET `/dashboard/records?model=&search=&limit=&offset=` | Page of records authorized for the current user |
| GET `/chat/messages` | Up to the latest 100 ChatMessage objects, oldest first |
| POST `/chat/messages` | `{ message }`; returns server-authored ChatMessage |
| POST `/realtime/tickets` | `{ ticket, expires_at }`, single use, short expiry |
| POST `/devices/` | `{ device_token, device_type: "Web" }` |
| DELETE `/devices/` | `{ device_token }`; unregister only the current user's device |

A page is `{ data, total, limit, offset }`. Domain schemas enforce the required fields after mapping. Error responses use `{ message }` and a meaningful HTTP status. No token, stack trace, or private upstream payload should appear in errors.

Socket/push event contracts are in [REALTIME.md](REALTIME.md). This is a template integration boundary; the exact JobLens construction-project and Obelisk business endpoints differ. Adapt the domain services and matching demo handlers together when targeting those APIs. Do not silently call an endpoint that only resembles the contract.
