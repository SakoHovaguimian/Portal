# Architecture

Portal is one npm application. There are no workspace packages, generated API SDK, controller adapters, or repositories.

## Browser data flow

Screen → query/mutation hook → domain service → `BrowserApiClient` → `/api/backend/*` → session verification/refresh → live API or `DemoApiClient`.

Domain services validate mutation inputs, encode paths/query parameters, and map transport data to domain models. The proxy supplies authentication; browser-supplied ownership or authorization headers are never forwarded. The real backend remains authoritative for permissions. The demo API enforces current-user ownership itself.

The browser calls Firebase only for opt-in Messaging. It never receives access/refresh tokens or calls Firebase Authentication. Client code imports public session models, never server containers or environment.

## Server composition

Root layout passes only a public runtime configuration to `RuntimeProvider`. Protected layouts read the encrypted cookie and pass a token-free `AppSession` to `AppProviders`. They never write cookies. Query loading occurs through the browser proxy, which can safely refresh cookies in a Route Handler. `proxy.ts` provides navigation gating; API routes independently verify sessions.

`container.ts` wires live Firebase REST auth or demo auth plus `SessionService`. `/api/backend/*` chooses live forwarding or demo state using the same server-only `DEMO_MODE` value. No client build flag selects mock behavior.

## State ownership

- TanStack Query: server data, request status, cache and mutation invalidation.
- URL: committed filters, selected dashboard model, list query.
- Component state: forms, disclosure, pending UI.
- Zustand: existing dashboard density/chrome only; do not duplicate server data there.
- Local storage: appearance, consent choice, per-user push opt-in and FCM registration identifier. Never auth tokens.
- Server process: demo records and demo credentials. Live data lives on the backend.

The existing custom UI system remains in `src/components/ui`; this migration does not replace it with Astryx. See [migration decisions](MIGRATION.md).
