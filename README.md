# Portal

A single npm application built with Next.js **16.2.10**, React **19.2.4**, strict TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and TanStack Query. Domain modules call an API client through an authenticated Next.js backend proxy. Shared React Aria/Radix UI primitives and Portal’s light/dark accent themes live in the same application.

## Start with the demo

Requires Node 22.

```sh
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3001. The sample environment sets `DEMO_MODE=true`. Sign in with `sako@example.com` and `password123`, or create a demo account. Demo mutations are stored in server memory across navigation and reloads; restarting the server restores fixtures.

Demo mode includes users, profile updates, feature requests, dashboard counts, a shared chat, and simulated alerts. It makes no Firebase, backend, Socket.IO, Messaging, or Amplitude calls. Optional analytics and browser push controls explain their demo state.

## Live mode

Set `DEMO_MODE=false`, provide `PORTAL_API_URL`, `FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY`, and a random `SESSION_SECRET` of at least 32 characters, then restart. `PORTAL_API_URL` includes the backend prefix, such as `http://localhost:3000/api`. Configure optional Socket.IO, Firebase Messaging, and Amplitude values from [.env.example](.env.example).

The backend must implement the [documented contract](docs/BACKEND_CONTRACT.md). This frontend does not create backend chat, ticket, device, or business endpoints. Missing live integrations are not silently replaced with demo data.

Authentication uses Firebase REST on the server. Access and refresh tokens live in an encrypted HTTP-only session cookie. Browser calls use `/api/backend/*`; the proxy refreshes tokens and forwards the bearer and app-version headers. Socket.IO uses short-lived tickets. Firebase Messaging is explicitly opt-in. Amplitude loads only after consent; no Sentry frontend integration is included.

## Commands

```sh
npm run dev
npm run check
DEMO_MODE=true npm run build
DEMO_MODE=true npm start
npm run check:strings
```

The repository contains no tests by instruction. `check` runs ESLint, route-aware TypeScript, and the display-string check. Keep the npm lockfile committed.
