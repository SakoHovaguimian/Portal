# AGENTS.md

Portal is a Node 22 / TypeScript web template using Next.js 16.2.10, React 19.2.4, Tailwind v4, and TanStack Query. It is one npm application. This file is the task index; detailed rules live in the linked guides.

## Standing rules

- Do not create a worktree unless explicitly requested.
- Do not write tests. Do not run Xcode builds unless explicitly requested. Verify with static checks, the web build, and focused manual workflows.
- Split independent models into separate files. Keep each schema, inferred type, and directly derived input schema together.
- All user-visible strings belong in [src/strings](src/strings/), including labels, metadata, validation, errors, accessibility text, notifications, and static demo copy. Use named formatters for interpolation. Never place new display copy inline.
- Follow domain service → API client → authenticated Next.js backend proxy. Never call the backend or Firebase Authentication from browser components.
- Keep credentials and tokens server-only. Client session models contain user information only. The Firebase browser SDK is used for Messaging, never authentication.
- `DEMO_MODE=true` must work without a backend, Firebase, Socket.IO, Messaging, or Amplitude. Preserve demo ownership and validation rules when adding endpoints.
- Preserve user changes and the existing UI system. Search for a matching model, service, component, or string before creating one. Do not add workspace packages or a repository/controller layer.
- Read relevant installed Next.js docs under `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before changing framework APIs; this project uses `proxy.ts` and asynchronous cookies/params.

## Read only what the task needs

Choose the matching rows below. Read the guide and nearest implementation, then follow direct callers and contracts. Explicit user instructions take precedence. Verify actual container wiring and scripts before assuming a feature is active. Repair stale links when found.

## Verify and maintain

- Run `npm run check` for source changes and `DEMO_MODE=true npm run build` for application changes. Run `git diff --check` for every change.
- Exercise affected flows in the browser. Use local demo data; do not send live analytics, notifications, or backend writes as routine verification.
- Report actual checks and distinguish demo verification from live integration verification.
- Update affected docs when routes, contracts, environment, ownership, or wiring change. Keep this index short; place details in a focused guide and link it here.
